Typescript allows to write js in more precise manners so there errors are less

Typescript is all about type safety




#### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What does <T> mean?
T is a generic type.

Think of it like:

“I don’t know yet what type of data I’ll fetch — you’ll tell me later.”
“A placeholder for a real type that will be decided later.”
Why <T> is correct here

the hook is generic:

export function useFetch<T>(url: string): FetchState<T>


This hook:

Fetches data from any API

Does not know what shape the data will be

But expects the caller to define it

So <T> means:

“I don’t know the data shape, but you must tell me.”

Who defines the structure then?
The caller does ✅
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const { data, loading, error } = useFetch<User>(
  "/api/users/1"
);


Now TypeScript knows:

data: User | null


🎯 Structure is still defined — just not inside the hook


## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In TypeScript, you should define structure for both sending and receiving data.


## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm i some-lib
npm i -D @types/some-lib

you can install dependencies type by using this command if dependency dont have type
